# Using CNN identifying fake Indian notes
 Identifies if given Indian note is fake or not

## Overview
Counterfeit currency is a growing problem that affects the economy and financial security. This project aims to develop a **deep learning-based detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to differentiate between **genuine and fake Indian currency notes**. The model is trained on images of â‚¹2000 and â‚¹500 notes to identify counterfeit currency efficiently.
